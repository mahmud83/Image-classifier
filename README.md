# Image-classifier

This project conatains the implementation of an image classifier using L-layered Artificial Neural Network developed from scratch without the use of any frameworks. Forward Prop and Back Prop have been implemented on python. I used cats for testing it. This model predicts if the image is a cat or not. 
dnn.py contains helper function.
dnn_app.py contains the main application.
